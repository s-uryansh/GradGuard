Honeypots are widely used in cyber-security research and operations to observe attacker behavior, collect threat intelligence, and study emerging attack techniques. However, modern attackers increasingly perform honeypot fingerprinting,where systems are actively monitored to determine whether they are interacting with a decoy or a real production environment.Once a honeypot is identified, attackers often terminate the session, significantly reducing the value and reliability of the collected data.

Most existing honeypot systems operate in a static and passive manner, being unaware of when attackers are testing or identifying them. Furthermore, the majority of current research ignores attacker reactions, cross-layer behavioral signals, and adaptive responses in favor of attack detection and data collection. Honeypots are therefore still vulnerable to detection, which results in shorter interaction times, biased datasets, and less effectiveness in threat analysis in the real world.

A self-aware honeypot system that can recognize behavioral patterns suggestive of honeypot fingerprinting and dynamically modify its behavior to maintain deception without obstructing or interfering with legitimate traffic is required. When operating on actual attack traffic in a controlled research environment, such a system must prioritize high precision in order to prevent false positives.
